 1. Open the .stp file from SignalTap

 2. Program a signal generator to generate a waveform

 3. Program device

 4. Device will start operation

 5. Run simulation

 6. Trigger arrives after ~10 seconds after device programming

 7. Once trigger arrives, do File > Export in SignalTap

 8. Export to .csv, set time to 1us (each sample in memory is 1us apart)

 9. Open the .csv in a text editor

10. Remove lines up to sample number 130

11. Remove columns after the second (last one should contain hex numbers)

12. Change the hex number columns to something like:

="03E3" (forces Excel to interpret cell as text)

13. Add the following text at the end of all the lines in the .csv file:

,,"=indirect(address(row(),column()-3))-130/10","=hex2dec(indirect(address(row(),column()-3)))"

14. Save the .csv and open it in Excel

15. Check that all columns are properly converted

16. If not, make changes as needed in text editor and reopen in Excel

17. Save file as .xlsx (pay attention not to overwrite .csv)

18. In the .xlsx file, create a line graph of the data, using the following series:

X axis: ='<sheet_name>'!$d$1:$d$896
Y axis: ='<sheet_name>'!$e$1:$e$896

19. Enjoy your graph :)
